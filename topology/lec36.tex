\begin{theorem}
	If $X=A_1\cup A_2$ is the union of two path connected spaces and the intersection $A_1\cap A_2$ is a path connected subspace of $X$, then the fundamental group of $X$ is the free product of the fundamental groups of $A_1$ and $A_2$ quotiented by the smallest normal subgroup generated by the inclusion of the intersection $A_1\cap A_2$ in $X$.
