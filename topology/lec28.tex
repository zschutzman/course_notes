\definition{A \textbf{retract} (or \textbf{retraction}) is a map $r:X\rightarrow A$ where $A\subset X$ such that the restriction $r|_A$ is the identity on $A$.}

If $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is continuous, then $f$ induces a group homomorphism $f_*\pi_1(X,x_0)\rightarrow \pi_1(Y,f(x_0))$ which preserves homotopy classes of loops.  The function $f_*$ also preserves the group operation, as it is a homomorphism.

If $r:X\rightarrow A$ is a retract, then $r_*$ is a surjection (and an epimorphism of groups).
