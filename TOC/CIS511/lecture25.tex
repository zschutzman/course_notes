\section*{Optimization Problems}

Optimization problems usually minimize or maximize things.  We would like ways to solve $NP$-Complete optimization problems, like minimum Vertex Cover, maximum clique, etc.

\defn{An algorithm $A$ achieves an \textbf{approximation ratio} of $C$ if for all inputs $x$, $\frac{A(x)}{OPT(x)}\leq C$, where $A(x)$ is $A$'s result and $OPT(x)$ is the optimal result.}


\subsection*{Vertex Cover}
Let's think about Vertex Cover.  Given a graph $G$, we want to find the smallest set of vertices such that every edge of $G$ is incident to a vertex in the cover.  

\defn{A \textbf{maximal matching} is a set of edges in a graph which form a matching such that no other edge can be added and have it still remain a matching.}

A maximal matching can be found efficiently by a greedy algorithm.  Let $M$ be a maximal matching and $V(M)$ be the set of vertices in the matching.  We have $|V(M)|=2|M|$, so $OPT(G)\geq |M|$.  We claim $V(M)$ is a Vertex Cover.  To see this, suppose that it is not.  Then some edge $(u,v)$ is not covered by $V(M)$.  But then we could add $(u,v)$ to $M$, contradicting the assumption that $M$ is a maximal matching.

Therefore, a maximal matching is a $2$-approximation for finding a Vertex Cover.

Note that reductions do not necessarily preserve approximation factors.  Think of Vertex Cover and Independent Set.  Simply taking the complement of a $2$-approximate Vertex Cover could result in a size zero Independent Set if every vertex was added to the cover.  In fact, Independent Set is strongly non-approximable (as is clique), and finding a good approximation algorithm would prove $P=NP$

\subsection*{Set Cover}

Now, let's think of Set Cover.  Here, we are given a universe $S$ of $n$ elements and a collection of $m$ subsets $S_1,S_2,\dots, S_m$.  We want to find a minimum number of subsets such that their union is equal to $S$.  Vertex cover is a special case of Set Cover, where the universe is the set of edges and the subsets are the sets of edges incident to each vertex.

A greedy algorithm to approximate Set Cover is to iteratively pick the $S_i$ with the largest number of uncovered elements until we cover everything.  Suppose the greedy algorithm selects $k$ subsets $S_{i_1},S_{i_2}$.  We know that $S_{i_1}$ covers at least $\frac{n}{k}$ elements, as either it or a strictly smaller subset must be included in the optimal solution, as our greedy algorithm picks the largest subset at the first step.  Consider $S_{i_2}$.  For the same reason, we have that $S_{i_2}$ covers at least $\frac{n(1-\frac{1}{k})}{k}$ elements, and so on.  We can upper-bound the number of uncovered elements after $t$ rounds by $n(1-\frac{1}{k})^t$.  We want to find the $t$ such that this becomes smaller than $1$.  By taking some logarithms and doing algebra, we get $l\approx k\\ln(n)$ as the number of sets the greedy algorithm will choose.  This is therefore a $\ln(n)$-approximation to Set Cover.  We can also prove that this is tight.  If Set Cover has a $(\ln(n)-\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm, then $P=NP$.

\subsection*{Subset-Sum}

The optimization version of the Subset-Sum problem, which asks to find a subset of a universe $a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n$ whose sum is maximum subject to it being less than or equal to a target $T$.  To solve this exactly, we can just check all $2^n$ subsets, and pick the one that sums to the largest value less than or equal to $T$.  We can do this in exponential time with a dynamic programming approach by keeping an array $L$ such that $L_i$ is the list of sums we can get with a subset of the first $i$ elements, and we construct $L_{i+1}=L_i \oplus \{0,a_{i+1}\}$.  This runs in time $nT$, but running time of $T$ is not polynomial.

We can find an arbitrarily good approximation to this problem.  That is, for any $\epsilon>0$, we have $\frac{OPT(I)}{A(I)}=1+\epsilon$.  Our approximation is similar to the dynamic programming.  At each step, we eliminate from $L$ any value that is above $T$ or within a factor of $(1+\delta)$ of some other value.  That is, for each element $z$, eliminate all remaining elements between $z$ and $1+\delta$.  This trimming process means that we have elements that are no closer together than $z_1$, $z_1(1+\delta)$, $z_1(1+\delta)^2$, and so on, where $z_1$ is the first element of the list.

Since $z_1$ is at least $1$, there are at most $\log_{1+\delta}(T)$ elements in any $L_i$.  This is approximately $\frac{\log(T)}{\delta}$, so we get a relation that the length of the list increases as $\delta$ gets closer to zero.  We also know that the length of $L_{i+1}$ is twice that of $L_i$, but since we are trimming at each step, the list never gets too big.  $\log(T)$ is polynomial in $T$, so the total running time is $\frac{n\log(T)}{\delta}$.

How good of an approximation is this?  By pruning values, we get no further than $(1+\delta)^n$, so if we set $\delta=\frac{\epsilon}{n}$, we get an approximation factor which looks like $(1+\frac{\epsilon}{n})^n$, which is close to $e^\epsilon$, and for small $\epsilon$, this is roughly $1+\epsilon$.
