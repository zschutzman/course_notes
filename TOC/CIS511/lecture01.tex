\section*{Introduction}

Why theory?

\begin{enumerate}
	

\item Minimal approach to understanding the idea of \textbf{computation}.
\item What makes computation tick?
\item Theory anticipates technology.
\item Models of computation are interesting.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Mathematics!}

Should know:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sets
	\item Functions
	\item Relations
	\item Logic
	\item Proofs
	\item Graphs
\end{enumerate}

\defn{An \textbf{alphabet} is a non-empty, finite set of characters.}
\defn{A \textbf{string} $s$ (over an alphabet $\Sigma$) is a finite ordered sequence of elements of $\Sigma$.}
\defn{The \textbf{empty string}, $\epsilon$, is the sequence of no symbols, and is in fact a valid string.}
\defn{Let \textbf{$\Sigma^*$} be the set of all strings over $\Sigma$.}
\defn{A \textbf{language} over $\Sigma$ is any subset of $\Sigma^*$.}

The empty set is a language.  This is \textit{not} the same as the language only containing the empty string.


\section*{Finite State Machines: A First Model}

Scalability (asymptotics) is a requirement for any interesting model.

To compute on larger and larger inputs, a computer needs memory.  What is the minimum amount of memory you need to do something interesting?

\defn{A \textbf{finite state machine} will be a model with a constant amount of memory.}

The states of an FSM correspond to memory (a machine with k states can have $2^k$ 'bits' of memory).


Example: define the language $\mathcal{L} = \{s\in\Sigma^* | s\ has\ an\ odd\ number\ of\ 1s\}$.\\

\defn{A \textbf{deterministic finite automaton (DFA), $M$, is a 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma , \delta , q_0, F)$.}}
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[] $Q$, the set of states.
		\item[] $\Sigma$, the alphabet
		\item[] $\delta:Q\times\Sigma\rightarrow Q$, the transition function
		\item[] $q_0$, the start state
		\item[] $F$, the accept states
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
\defn{$M$ \textbf{accepts} a string $s=s_1 s_2 \dots s_k$ if there is a sequence of states in $M$ starting with $q_0$ and ending in a final state $q_0 q_1 \dots q_k$ such that $\delta(q_i,s_{i+1}) = q_{i+1}$.}

\defn{If $\mathcal{L} = \{s | M \ accepts \ s\}$, the we say $M$ \textbf{recognizes} $\mathcal{L}$.}
\defn{If a language $\mathcal{L}$ is recognized by some DFA, then it is \textbf{regular}.}

\defn{A \textbf{nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA), $M$, is a 5-tuple $(Q,\Sigma , \delta , q_0, F)$.}}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[] $Q$, the set of states.
		\item[] $\Sigma$, the alphabet
		\item[] $\delta:Q\times \Sigma\cup\{\epsilon\}\rightarrow\mathcal{P}(Q)$, the transition function
		\item[] $q_0$, the start state
		\item[] $F$, the accept states
	\end{enumerate}
	
	Now, $\delta$ maps the current state and input character or $\epsilon$ to some subset of states.

\defn{A string $s$ is \textbf{accepted} by and NFA $M$ if there is some path for $s$ from the start state to a final state.}
\defn{$M$ \textbf{recognizes} a language $\mathcal{L}$ consisting of all strings it accepts.}

Example: let $\mathcal{L} = \{s\ |\ the \ 3rd \ last \ character \ is \ a \ 1\}$.
