\textsl{{\Large These notes are from the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group's (MGGG) workshop at Tufts University, August 7th-11th, 2017.  For more information about the workshop itself, see \url{http://sites.tufts.edu/gerrymandr}. \linebreak\linebreak
		 As taking notes in \LaTeX\xspace on-the-fly is not an easy task, I am sure this document is full of typos, sloppy notation, and small mathematical errors.  If you find such an error, please send me an email at \{\texttt{ianzach+notes[at]seas.upenn.edu}\} so I can correct it.\\}}
